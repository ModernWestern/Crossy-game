# Chickens Cross the Road: The Ultimate Challenge üïπÔ∏è

Welcome to "Chickens Cross the Road: The Ultimate Challenge"! Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to help 5 fearless chickens cross to the other side. But here's the catch: each chicken only has 3 lives, so you gotta make sure they don't lose any!

Think you're up for the challenge? Great! Now, let's talk controls. You'll be moving the chickens using the trusty old WASD keys. Just make sure to be gentle with them - chickens may not have the best balance!

Remember, the road ahead is full of peril, with speeding cars and a raging river threatening to take down any chicken who's not up to the task. So, keep your wits about you and guide those feathered friends to safety.

Get ready for an egg-citing adventure and don't let the chickens down!
